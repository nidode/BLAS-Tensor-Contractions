// =============================================================================

To install these sources, you will need the following:

* libFLAME 
  We made this sources run on libFLAME release 11104.
  Previous releases or future releases of libFLAME might require some 
  slight modifications to these codes due to changes in libFLAME.
  We can help you with those.

* You may need some high-performance BLAS.
  We employed OpenBLAS.

Once you have installed libFLAME, you will have to adjust Makefile files
to compile these sources.
