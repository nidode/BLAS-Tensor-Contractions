This directory contains an automatic generator of correct BLAS kernel to used for any 2-tensor contractions

An example of how to use the script can be found in the file TryItOut.py. There all the classes of contractions described in the paper are described together with some additional tests. The reader can add or change to the file and run it by typing the command line

python TryItOut.py

The result will be presented in the form

Sum_b T1_b T2_b  (GEMV)
Sum_b T1_b T2_b  (GEMV)
Sum_c T1_c T2_c  (GEMV)
Sum_b T1_b T2_b  (GEMM)
Sum_c T1_c T2_c  (COPY+GEMM)
Forall_b Forall_d Sum_j T1_jb T2_jd  (GEMM)
Forall_b Forall_d Sum_j T1_jb T2_jd  (COPY+GEMM)
